# # 5-2. More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to ten. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
# # • Tests for equality and inequality with strings
# # • Tests using the lower() method
# # • Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
# # • Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
# # • Test whether an item is in a list
# # • Test whether an item is not in a list
