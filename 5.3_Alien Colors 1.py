# # 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
# # • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
# # • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

alien_color = "green"

    print("Player earned 5 points.")

# 2nd version of this program.

alien_color2 = "red"
